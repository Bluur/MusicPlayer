# MusicPlayer
.WAV MusicPlayer with the capability of making M3U, PLS &amp; XSPF Playlists.

This app uses the custom Class Cancion (Song), which has 3 basic attributes, Nombre (name), Ruta (Path) &amp; Duracion (length).

It has the capabilities to find and grab songs from your files using JFileChooser, it'll take the name and path from it, and if the song is
in .WAV it'll take the duration too, if it isn't in WAV, you'll have to introduce it manually.

You can save your playlists locally in M3U, PLS or XSPF format, this formats are recognised by VLC and (sometimes) windows media. In the future i'll add 
the capability to save it to a local SQL database using JDBC.

This is a class project from the Professional Training Course of Web Development in I.E.S Zaid√≠n Vergeles, Granada, Spain.
